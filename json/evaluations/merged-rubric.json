To understand how the VDR of a given Method maintains integrity, this criteria identifies the operational components of the VDR for further evaluation in other criteria, namely 4.6, 3.5, and 3.6.Unfortunately, network topology inevitably introduces parties that may be able to disrupt or compromise network interactions. For example, DNS servers--often under the control of the user’s ISP or the corporate IT department--can return “fake” IP addresses; corporate firewalls can prevent traffic to or from certain addresses; corporate system administrators may prevent users from configuring alternative Certificate Authorities, even international internet traffic can be restricted or denied, purely at the network layer.Because nearly every DID method known at this point depends on Internet-based networking, every DID method faces these same problems. As such, we don’t recommend specifying common network components as distinct layers unless those layers have specific roles unique to the particular DID method.For this criteria, we are talking about the operational components that have specific, unique, or privileged roles with regard to the evaluated DID Method(s). The parties which fulfill said roles should be considered when evaluating the fitness of the given method(s).",

This significantly mitigates denial of service or service interruptions for reading. Writes are submitted to 1/3 of the nodes in parallel, so attacks on individual nodes are unlikely to produce downtime. This behavior is validated with careful testing and has been demonstrated through four years of production usage with greater than 99% uptime. Sovrin adds to Indy's guarantees by publishing a node and network health dashboard , by maintaining statistics about the historic behavior of nodes, by having a publicly vetted node selection algorithm that forces nodes in different geographies and legal jurisdictions, and by having a written crisis management plan that has been exercised and reviewed by security professionals. However, a determined adversary might be able to reduce network write speed by submitting many transactions in parallel, for a sustained period of time."

However, recent signals from NIST suggest that (1) bitcoin use of cryptography is not prima facie out of compliance and (2) NIST’s previous evaluations of Schnorr hinged on patent concerns; now that those patents are expired, many are optimistic that Schnoor will be given serious consideration in future evaluations. IPFS allows non-approved hash algorithms through multihash, however did:ion adds the requirement that all hashes be SHA-256, which is NIST compliant.",
